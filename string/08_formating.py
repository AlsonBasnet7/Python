# 4. String Formatting and f-Strings
# Using format(), create a sentence:
# "My name is John and I am 25 years old."
# by passing "John" and 25 as variables.

# Do the same using f-strings.
name="John"
age="25"
print(f"My name is {name} adn I am {25} years old.")


name = "John"
age = 25

# Using format()
print("My name is {} and I am {} years old.".format(name, age))
